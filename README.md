# New repository template
This repository serves as a template for new repositories of the Spine framework.

Please see the [config][config-repo] repository
for shared configurations and scripts. `config` is added to this repository as a Git submodule.

## Applying the template
                              
### 1. Replace `"template"` with your project name

Search for `template` throughout the code and replace it with the name of your project.

### 2. Review the project structure  

Add at least one subproject. After adding the files and modifying `settings.gradle.kts`, search for
the `TODO` items in the files in this repo. They may contain instructions on finalizing the setup.
